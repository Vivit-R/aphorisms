Perl is like duct tape.  It's easy  to  use and great for quick and dirty fixes,
but if you try to solve every problem with it, you're going to make a mess.

Haskell is a fun toy, but it's like writing a haiku.  It's not how you achieve a 
goal unless part of the goal is writing a haiku.

A pointer  is  ike  a  tightly-wrapped  package.  It might  be  labeled  as  one 
particular type of thing,  but sometimes it's unlabeled,  and sometimes it's not
even correctly labeled.   You have no way of knowing  what's inside of  it until
you open it.  It  might  contain  nothing  at all,  it might contain garbage, it
might contain something valuable that  was damaged by the postal service because
the package was mislabeled, or it might contain a letter bomb.

Moral of the story: make sure you've got the right thing wrapped before you send
it -- and make sure it has enough stamps.

/* Historical note: The original versions of Hack used a range of damage
 * which was similar to, but not identical to the damage used in Advanced
 * Dungeons and Dragons.  I figured that since it was so close, I may as well
 * make it exactly the same as AD&D, adding some more weapons in the process.
 * This has the advantage that it is at least possible that the player would
 * already know the damage of at least some of the weapons.  This was circa
 * 1987 and I used the table from Unearthed Arcana until I got tired of typing
 * them in (leading to something of an imbalance towards weapons early in
 * alphabetical order).  The data structure still doesn't include fields that
 * fully allow the appropriate damage to be described (there's no way to say
 * 3d6 or 1d6+1) so we add on the extra damage in dmgval() if the weapon
 * doesn't do an exact die of damage.
 *
 * Of course new weapons were added later in the development of Nethack.  No
 * AD&D consistency was kept, but most of these don't exist in AD&D anyway.
 *
 * Second edition AD&D came out a few years later; luckily it used the same
 * table.  As of this writing (1999), third edition is in progress but not
 * released.  Let's see if the weapon table stays the same.  --KAA
 * October 2000: It didn't.  Oh, well.

The  quality  that makes  you  go  to  great  effort  to reduce  overall  energy
expenditure.  It  makes you write labor-saving  programs  that other people will
find  useful,  and document  what you wrote  so you don't have to answer so many
questions about it.  Hence, the first great virtue of a programmer ...  see also

The  anger  you  feel  when the  computer is being lazy.  This  makes  you write
programs  that don't just react to your needs, but actually anticipate them.  Or 
at least pretend to.  Hence,  the second great virtue of a programmer.  See also
"laziness" and "hubris".

Excessive pride,  the sort of  thing Zeus zaps you for.  Also  the quality  that

things  about.  Hence,  the  third  great  virtue  of  a  programmer.  See  also

We  are  about to  study  the idea  of  a computational  process.  Computational
processes are abstract beings that inhabit computers.  As they evolve, processes
manipulate  other  abstract things  called data.  The evolution  of a process is
directed  by  a  pattern  of rules called  a program.  People create programs to
direct processes.  In effect,  we conjure the spirits of  the computer with  our
spells."
